Soon, Christmases and birthdays inevitably included the ritual unveiling of his latest bespoke piece, gifted because his own house was already crammed.</p>
              <p class="para2">Matt has had a varied career in engineering, starting off in the early days as a machinist. He has worked in aerospace, nuclear and now on oil, gas and subsea engineering projects. </p>

                But to create and run his own business has long been his dream. Matt does all the designing, metalwork and woodwork at Rustic Fox.

Jenny started upcycling and repurposing furniture for resale online, finally bringing Matt’s skills to bear to make Rustic Fox what it is today.</p>
              <p class="para4">Jenny now takes charge of customer service. She assists in making up orders as well as rolling up her sleeves and finishing and waxing our pieces</p>
